What do developers do? What principles of a developer have you learned?

Developers today are the creators and teachers of software development. They create, design, maintain and update software so that a user can use it to get a specific job done. Developers are highly involved with the designing phase so that they are able to cater their work to a users need. After developing their work, then they teach how to use what they created so that they can have a successful following with their users. After being at the Iron Yard for a week and two days, I've learned that you need to write the code and design the code based off how one navigates through all the navigation controllers. The faster someone can navigate through your app and view the data, the more they want to continue to use it.

Explain how the user experience of your app should impact how you design and construct your code. How should user-focused considerations affect your code structure?

Having a user-focused mentality when it comes to designing an app or a product is crucial to the success of the developer. As we know, there are multiple apps and products that are out there in the digital world but not all are easy to use and that is because not all were created with a user-focused mentality. An example of this is Apple comes out with yearly products that get better with time and effort. Each time they come out with a software pack, or a new device, they have this whole system in where they design their products to be used by grandparents and kids. If they make something simple and elegant that even the non tech grandparents could use, then your normal everyday person can use its product as well. Apple is so effective with how they connect with the user, that they have a whole generation of kids growing up learning and using their device as second nature. As a new developer, I firmly believe in Apples structure of catering to its users. Basing ones code structure by how a user would navigate through an app is effective because then it makes you an effective developer who can design and create for a vast majority, which in the long run can also make you a profitable developer.

Explain the branching principle in Git. Why do we branch? What does branching enable for our codebase?

Branching in Git is like having a word.doc with an essay typed out into it that needs to be used for a class in traditional schooling. Now the word.doc contains a rough draft of what the essay is suppose to be. So what the student does, is makes a copy of that rough draft, and uses it to start working on a final draft. The student can use that one copy of the rough draft once or more to create its final draft for submission. Branching has the same concept. It takes whatever code, app, software you are working on and makes copies of it so that you can work in it without affecting its original content. Once you create a final copy you can submit it as the main or master copy of what you were working on, allowing others to use it. Branching enables a group of developers to work on a project so that they can modify, fix, or add features to it. It also enables developers to test ideas without putting the main project at risk.
