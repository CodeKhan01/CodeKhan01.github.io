After three weeks of being at the Iron Yard. I can truly say its been one hell of a journey. Ive learned a lot, met a lot of people, and slowly learning how to get a grip on my work and continue working even after I get home. The reason I say that its been one hell of a journey, is because I can feel the wheels in my head turning, to truly have a growth mindset. Im learning to drop my ego, and ask questions even if its something we learned in week one. Im finally starting to see a balance in learning, applying, and still having a life outside the Iron Yard. In order for me to be successful, Ive cut off social networks for now mainly because the time I put in Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, can be applied to Slack, GitHub, Linkedin, Trello, and so forth. The funny thing is that I am so engaged in trying to understand what I am learning at the Iron Yard, that I don't miss those external social networks and I am completely happy to be using the ones that the Iron Yard is training us to use. 

Regarding to the people I have met, I am genuinely happy to have met every single person at the Iron Yard. My classmates are all one of a kind and I love watching them react to what we do, and how they go about their thinking, and how they tackle these apps that we work on. From Ben, I have learned that its ok to ask questions even if its something small, that no small question makes a man stupid. Brian has helped me understand basic logic of coding, and also helped me realize that I need to pay more attention to what I am focused on in class. He asked a simple question like "What exactly did you learn today in class?" and for some reason my mind went blank and I could not described what Ben just finished teaching us for the last 2 hours. I believe I was stunned at the moment he had asked me because he was on his computer learning Python, and then randomly asked me what I learned, and that was basically the last thing I expected him to ask me while being in the open area. At the end of it all, I simply wanted to tell him that Ben taught us how to use the User Interface Popover Controller, how to configure the segue function when dealing with multiple view controllers and trying to transfer data between view controllers. Though it didn't come out like that, trying to explain what I learned to Brian was a bit of a process, and might of sounded like ebonics, but non of the less he understood what I was trying to say. So that was a memorable moment for week three. 

Having the one on one session with Susanna, showed me that the staff at this Iron Yard location really does care about their students, and they want us to succeed at the highest level that we can achieve while being here. Meeting Dana was cool, especially since she is trying to make us look good for our profiles so that we can get jobs, and connecting us to other alumni's that are associated with the Iron Yard. Even though I am unsure how everything is going to work out, I would really like to be an alumni of the Iron Yard because this would be the first school that I am an alumni too, and hopefully my experiences can help those that will come after me once I do complete the program.

Having Ben's father come in and teach us about databases was very interesting. Though databases are important and he took the time to teach us, what was more important to me was his conviction of being in the industry for thirty years, and how he has created a following in his own family, and raised a next generation of programmers. He showed that coding is fun, can be long term, and can be an enjoyable job even years down the road. I also learned that its ok to be a little lazy but as long as your lazy in the right areas. You can still work, and be effective, but if you are able to take care of the problem from the beginning then you don't have to do it later on down the road. Basically working smart and not hard! I also liked his mini story in how he got into computer science and how he still looks back at the first program that he created. He described that first program like if he was Tony Stark creating the Iron Man suit. So that brought me some excitement in what we are doing, and I can't wait to have that excitement for my first full functioning app in the Swift language. Joseph also brought clarity that there is a process and a pattern to coding and I just have to find it as I tackle these daily assignments. 
 
Outside of learning something new daily and meeting new people constantly, Im simply trying to be a good student who can learn what is taught during lecture hours and apply them immediately after lunch whether I understand them or not. Three weeks into the program, the coding that Ben does in lecture is starting to look like english to me. Though I have no confidence to start on my own, and still having issues tackling the homework assignments both in class and at home, I am happy that I can comprehend what Ben is doing and that my time is not going in vein. The best way to describe my process here is that in the first two weeks my mind was like an empty array with no characters stored in the elements. In week three, I was able to fill in my array with a few characters, which is allowing me to have more insight in what I need to do next, and I am hoping in week four I am able to have complete data in my array so that I can call them to tackle these homework assignments and coding katas.
